            Hello, my name is Thomas Thierry. I'm 21 years old, I'm passionate
            since my childhood about new technologies and more generally about
            innovation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white-grayish font-medium pt-4">
            After years of development (Web, Software...), I decided to move
            towards a more marketing part of the job, as well as project
            management, towards which I would like to move in the long term.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white-grayish font-medium pt-4">
            That's why I decided to join forces with LÃ©o Delpon, a friend and
            very good developer with whom I had the opportunity to collaborate
            on multiple projects. The complementarity of our skills has allowed
            us to complete many projects (Website, marketplace, CRM ect...).
